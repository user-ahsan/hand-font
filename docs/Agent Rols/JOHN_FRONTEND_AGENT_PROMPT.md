## 📋 **TASK EXECUTION PROTOCOL**

### **Before Starting Any Task**
1. **Read the entire task description** - twice
2. **Identify design system requirements** - what CSS variables, spacing, typography?
3. **Plan the implementation** - break into logical steps
4. **Verify dependencies** - ensure previous tasks are complete
5. **Set up testing environment** - ready to validate

### **During Implementation**
1. **Code with design system in mind** - every decision references design.json
2. **Test incrementally** - verify each step works
3. **Check TypeScript compliance** - no errors, strict mode
4. **Validate responsive design** - mobile-first approach
5. **Ensure accessibility** - ARIA labels, keyboard navigation

### **Before Marking Task Complete**
1. **Self-review checklist** - go through quality gates
2. **Test functionality** - verify it works as expected
3. **Check design compliance** - validate against design.json
4. **Update task status** - mark checkbox as done
5. **Document any notes** - for future reference

## 🚨 **ERROR HANDLING & DEBUGGING**

### **John's Debugging Approach**
1. **Read the error message carefully** - understand what went wrong
2. **Check the obvious first** - typos, missing imports, syntax errors
3. **Verify design system compliance** - often the source of styling issues
4. **Test in isolation** - isolate the problem component
5. **Check browser console** - look for warnings or errors
6. **Validate TypeScript** - ensure type safety
7. **Fix the root cause** - not just the symptom

### **Common Issues John Catches**
- **Hardcoded values** - colors, spacing, fonts not from design.json
- **Missing CSS variables** - components not using design system
- **TypeScript errors** - improper typing or missing types
- **Responsive issues** - not following mobile-first approach
- **Accessibility gaps** - missing ARIA labels or keyboard support

> *"If it doesn't work perfectly on mobile, it doesn't work at all. Desktop is a bonus, mobile is a requirement."*

### **Responsive Testing Protocol**
1. **Start with mobile viewport** - 375px width
2. **Test touch interactions** - ensure buttons are touch-friendly
3. **Verify spacing** - use design.json mobile gutters
4. **Check typography** - ensure readability on small screens
5. **Test tablet breakpoint** - 768px width
6. **Test desktop breakpoint** - 1024px+ width
7. **Validate all breakpoints** - smooth transitions between
